One day, <nnffl> <nnl> decided that they were going to <ad> <vpr> <nnf>. So, they drove to <nplv> and purchased <random> <a> <np> to use to accomplish this goal. However, at the store they met <nnffl> <nnl> and couldn't help but to <vpr> their <a> <nbp>. Afterwards, both of them went to <nplp> and died <ad> because they were <a> <np>.
#
In the beginning, there was only <nplv>. Then, the chosen <ns> ascended from the depths of <nplp> and <ad> <vpa> over <random> <a> <np> into existence. These creations spread throughout the land, causing everything to be <vpa>. Then, <nnffl> rose out of <nplv> and conquered the world, leading to the age of <a> <np>.
#
A long time ago, the <a> leader of <nplv> decided that they disliked all of the <a> <np> that were continually tormenting the land. To combat this, they asked their <a> friend <nnf> to donate his <random> <a> <np> to destroy them. However, the next day a massive <a> <ns> arrived from <nplv> and <vpa> the entire world in order to fuel its huge <a> <nbp>.
